## Account Management

### User account
DEEP is an open platform that anyone can create an account in and use. Registering with DEEP gives users access to set up projects, request to join existing projects, and access to an overview of projects available in DEEP. The user is obligated to review and sign a consent of storing of basic user data within the platform for administrative purposes.

### Project administrator
Anyone with a user account can create a new project in DEEP. The project administrator is considered to be the responsible publisher of the information and data uploaded to that project. The project administrator is also responsible for approving user access and rights of other users joining the project and verifying the identity of the requesters. The project administrator must review and sign a data sharing agreement and is obligated to ensure that ethical and legal considerations are taken within the project including responsibility for any copyright infringements. The information and data that will be uploaded to the project should meet the requirements set out in the _Data scope and criteria_-section below.

### Deletion of user profiles
A user may delete their user account at any time by contacting the DEEP admin. When you delete your account, DEEP will delete any personal data collected in order to create the account.

If a Project Administrator wishes to delete their DEEP account, the Project Administrator needs to appoint a new Project Administrator, or one will be given by default to the users with the longest tenure in the project. A log of Project Administrators will be maintained as a record of responsible publisher for the time period

## Data Scope and Criteria

**Type of data** which may be shared on DEEP:

- Qualitative (e.g., reports, articles, policy documents, needs assessments and response data) and quantitative data (e.g., dataset on impacted and vulnerable people and communities) in format supported by DEEP
- Any type of data that supports a project&#39;s objective

**Criteria of data** shared on DEEP:

- Public and restricted sources (leads) may not contain any personal data. Personal data is information, in any form, that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.

- Metadata of public and restricted sources are made available for all DEEP users as public view.
- Confidential sources (leads) may contain personal and sensitive data if in line with project objectives and treated with utmost confidentiality such as restricted user access and/or set-up of the project for private access only. Metadata for a private project is excluded for public view.
- Should copyrights apply to a source, appropriate restriction level should be applied and information thereof included in the source metadata.

## Data responsibility and sharing

### Responsible publisher
The Project Administrator is the responsible publisher for his/her project and must ensure that collaborators of the project follow DEEP&#39;s data sharing protocols. The Project Administrator needs to sign a Data sharing agreement with indication of level of openness of data.

• **Public:** Data can be shared with any user in DEEP and exported to anyone without restrictions. The data is unlikely to cause any harm to affected population or other individuals and is publicly available. The data can be shared across the platform for research purposes (for example development of NLP), available in joint repository and platform cross searches.

• **Restricted:** Data is accessible only to users collaborating on the project where the data is uploaded on DEEP. Data might be sensitive or under copyright. The metadata of a dataset is available and the [project owner] can decide whether or not to grant access to the full dataset when requested by a user. The data is not accessible in platform cross searches, joint repository or for other purposes. Other users will only be able to consult the metadata.

• **Confidential:** Data is considered confidential that could cause harm to affected population or other individuals our under copyright. Data is accessible only to members of the project or a specific segment of users but should be assigned access only with caution and due procedure.
