## Account Management

### User account
DEEP is an open platform that anyone can create a user account in and use. Registering with DEEP gives users access to set up projects, request to join existing projects, and access to an overview of projects available in DEEP. The user is obligated to review and sign a consent of storing of basic user data within the platform for administrative purposes.
### Project Owner
Anyone with a user account can create a new project in DEEP and will be designated its Project Owner. At creation of a project, the Project Owner is asked to review and sign a data sharing agreement. The Project Owner is considered to be the responsible publisher of the information and data uploaded to that project. The Project Owner is also responsible for approving user access and rights of other users joining the project and verifying the identity of the requesters. The Project Owner is obligated to ensure that ethical and legal considerations are taken into account within the project including responsibility for any copyright infringements. The information and data that will be uploaded to the project should meet the requirements set out in the _Data scope and criteria_-section below.
### Deletion of user profiles
A user may delete their user account at any time. Any personal data collected in order to create the account will be deleted. DEEP reserves the right to a right to delete user accounts or deny user access to the platform without notice if, for example, the user is violating these terms of use or using the platform in an inappropriate manner.
If a Project Owner wishes to delete their DEEP account, the Project Owner needs to appoint a new Project Owner, or the user with the longest tenure in the project will be designed as such by default. A log of Project Owners will be maintained as a record of responsible publisher for the time period.

## Data Responsibility and Sharing
### Responsible publisher
The Project Owner is the responsible publisher for his/her project and must ensure that collaborators of the project follow DEEP&#39;s data sharing protocols. The Project Owner needs to sign a Data sharing agreement with indication of level of openness of data.

### Restriction levels
There are currently two levels of restriction impacting data sharing on DEEP:
- **Public:** Data can be shared with any user in DEEP and exported to anyone without restrictions. The data is unlikely to cause any harm to affected population or other individuals and is publicly available. The data can be shared across the platform for research purposes (for example development of NLP), available in joint repository and platform cross searches.
- **Confidential:** Data is considered confidential that could cause harm to affected population or other individuals our under copyright. Data is accessible only to members of the project or a specific segment of users but should be assigned access only with caution and due procedure. The Project Administrator can decide whether or not to grant access to the data. The data is not accessible in platform cross searches, joint repository or for other purposes. Other users will only be able to consult the metadata.
### Private project
